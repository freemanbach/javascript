Doing some research on the various types of JS frameworks available in 2019. This was the list of JS framework which i found to be
quite popular among web developers. Many to most of these JS frameworks are opensource projects made available for the masses to easily be downloaded on your linux / AppleOS maybe window machine. i cant guarantee that all of them would work in an window7/8/10 environment but some of them will work in an window7/8/10 environment by using the npm tool (yarn,bower,ndm). There is only a limited amount of time remaining to learn a few of these frameworks, i will try to learn as many before end of sommer 2019 with some quick examples on a few of the JS frameworks.
